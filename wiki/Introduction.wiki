By the time of writing this program I could not find proper information about [http://linux.die.net/man/4/epoll epoll] with any simple exmaple or tutorial, and I started to develop my own simple project seChat ("Simple Epoll Chat") based on epoll to investigate its features. Here I wanted to share my own impressions of the [http://linux.die.net/man/4/epoll epoll] and help others to use seChat sources as start point to develop/test/investigate something.

= General task & notes =

Our task - create a chat with simple programs, as:
 # *server*
  # Listens to a predefined ip address and port, and "register" all incoming clients;
  # Identifies each new client when connecting;
  # Receives a message from any client, and sends to all but the "sender";
 # *client* can receive and send messages simultaneously;
 # *tester* - a simple test program to load on the server with a large number of simultaneous connections.

Several additional notes:
 # [http://linux.die.net/man/4/epoll epoll] is used to control the events of new messages for server and client application;
 # For all unknown commands and functions consult to manual, everything is well described;
 # For simplicity:
  # I'm not using the "normal" error handlers, and any exceptions call exit code (which  very useful solution at the stage of coding and testing!). Ideally, the program should handle the error and try to return to the "normal job state", but I tried to be keep code as simple at is possible;
  # I hardcoded ip address and port - i'm lazy :-), but you free to change source to run program like '*./server ip port*' or '*./client 192.168.1.1:1234*'.
