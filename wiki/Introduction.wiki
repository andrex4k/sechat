#Be simple.

= Introduction =
By the time of writing this program I could not find proper information about [http://linux.die.net/man/4/epoll epoll] with any simple exmaple or tutorial, and I started to develop my own simple project seChat ("Simple Epoll Chat") based on epoll to investigate its features. Here I wanted to share my own impressions of the [http://linux.die.net/man/4/epoll epoll] and help others to use seChat sources as start point to develop/test/investigate something.

= General task & notes =

Our task is to create a chat with simple programs, as:
 # *server*
  # Listens to a predefined ip address and port, and "register" all incoming clients;
  # Identifies each new client when connecting;
  # Receives a message from any client, and sends to all but the "sender";
 # *client* can receive and send messages simultaneously;
 # *tester* - a simple test program to load on the server with a large number of simultaneous connections.
